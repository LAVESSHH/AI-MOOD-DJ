🧠 Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: AI Mood DJ — Hand → Face → Music
Subtitle: Let AI detect your emotions and play the perfect track
Include:
🎵 Abstract soundwave graphic
💻 Your name and school
🔹 Tech used: OpenCV | Python | Pygame
Slide 2: Problem Statement
"Music changes our mood — but what if our mood could change the music?"
People often struggle to pick songs that match how they feel.
Manual selection interrupts workflow or relaxation.
Lack of emotional personalization in standard music apps.
Need for emotion-aware automation to enhance digital experiences.
🧩 Goal: Create a system that can detect a user’s emotional state in real time and play suitable music automatically.
Slide 3: AI Solution (Concept / Prototype)
Concept:
AI Mood DJ combines computer vision and emotion recognition to detect how you feel using a webcam, then plays a song matching your vibe.
Prototype Workflow:
✋ Hand Detection → activates the system.
😊 Face Detection → identifies emotion (happy, sad, neutral).
🎶 Music Recommendation → auto-plays song based on mood.
Tools Used:
OpenCV (for video processing)
Python (logic + integration)
Pygame (for audio playback)
Slide 4: Implementation Approach
1. Data & Detection
Haar Cascade classifiers detect face and smile.
Frame-by-frame image analysis via OpenCV.
Simple rule-based mood classification (smile = happy, no smile = sad).
2. Architecture Flow:
User → Camera Input → Emotion Detection → Mood Classifier → Music Output
3. Interface:
Built using Tkinter GUI
Threaded process for smooth hand + face tracking
Slide 5: Potential Impact
Personal Use:
Auto-curated music experience based on real emotions
Mental wellness support through adaptive sound
Educational Use:
Demonstrates real-world AI and computer vision
Encourages emotion-aware computing projects
Technical Impact:
Promotes lightweight AI applications without cloud dependency
Slide 6: Business / Societal Value
Business Value:
Could be integrated into streaming apps like Spotify or Apple Music for emotion-driven playlists
Opens scope for personalized advertising and recommendation systems
Societal Value:
Mood-based therapy or stress management through music
Accessibility boost for visually impaired users (hands-free experience)
Promotes human-AI emotional synergy
